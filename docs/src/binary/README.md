# Game Binary Internals

This gives a brief overview of what an example project setup could look like,
what the build process for the project is, and what the emitted binary structure
is. This focuses on what builds with the C SDK look like, and does not address lua
at all.

NOTE:
> This uses the `C_API/Examples/Life` example from the SDK extensively.
