# A Game of Life

This is going to to a quick "once over" of the code they gave as example
for [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
`Life` is a classic nerd example and is fairly straghforward.

This is more concerned with the actual effect of the code layout as opposed to the
code itself.


The initial file strucure of `Life` looks like:

```bash
$ tree
CMakeLists.txt
main.c
Makefile
Source/
  - pdxinfo
```

We can basically ignore the pdxinfo for now, and the Makefile as well. CMake is more powerful than Make and allows for cleaner builds imo and its easier to decipher wtf is actually going on so we'll look at CMakeLists.txt.

Note the lines:

```cmake
if (TOOLCHAIN STREQUAL "armgcc")
	add_executable(${PLAYDATE_GAME_DEVICE} ${SDK}/C_API/buildsupport/setup.c main.c)
else()
	add_library(${PLAYDATE_GAME_NAME} SHARED main.c )
endif()

include(${SDK}/C_API/buildsupport/playdate_game.cmake)
```

As we're focusing on binaries for the actual device we don't actually care about the else branch.

## Input files
The input compilation units to this game are going to be:

- setup.c (provided by SDK)
- main.c (from user code)


### `main.c`

What main does in general is entirely up to the user, but [as per the docs](https://sdk.play.date/1.12.3/Inside%20Playdate%20with%20C.html#_game_initialization), must contain, at a minimum:

- overwrite [`playdate->system->setUpdateCallback()`](https://sdk.play.date/1.12.3/Inside%20Playdate%20with%20C.html#f-system.setUpdateCallback) for the pure C project.
- implement `eventHandler()`

### what is `setup.c`?

This is where a lot of the play.date *magic* happens, and is a file provided in the SDK.
At a high level it is putting a more accessible name of their allocator in scope, and making wrappers around `malloc()`, `free()`,
and `realloc()`. Then is arranging the sections in the compilation unit so that the entry to
your defined code is always in the same place. This simplifies their API to all games and
is a really cool API decision on their part.

So how do they do all of this?

With \*code\*:

```c
PDEventHandler* PD_eventHandler __attribute__((section(".capi_handler"))) = &eventHandlerShim;

extern uint32_t bssStart asm("__bss_start__");
uint32_t* _bss_start __attribute__((section(".bss_start"))) = &bssStart;

extern uint32_t bssEnd asm("__bss_end__");
uint32_t* _bss_end __attribute__((section(".bss_end"))) = &bssEnd;
```

### `.capi_handler`

`bss` okay cool thats standard `C` programming stuff (initialized 0 memory),
but what is `.capi_handler`??? According to OpenAI's ChatGPT:

```
The .capi_handler section is a section of memory in a program that is reserved for storing data related to C++ exception handling. This data is used by the C++ runtime library to implement the C++ exception handling mechanism.

In a C++ program, when an exception is thrown, the exception object is passed to the C++ runtime library, which searches for an exception handler that is capable of handling the exception. The runtime library uses the data stored in the .capi_handler section to determine which exception handlers are available and how to invoke them.

The .capi_handler section is created by the linker when it links a C++ program. The linker generates the .capi_handler section based on information in the object files generated by the compiler.
```

Cool, so it sounds like they took advantage of the fact that the input code is only `C`, then
threw a pointer to the event handler in a section that would otherwise be unpopulated.

But what is the thing they are putting in that section? `eventHandlerShim()` is not a user
function.

Shim code:

```c
int eventHandlerShim(PlaydateAPI* playdate, PDSystemEvent event, uint32_t arg)
{
	if ( event == kEventInit )
		pdrealloc = playdate->system->realloc;
	
	return eventHandler(playdate, event, arg);
}
```

The shim makes sure that the allocator pointer is headed to the right place before any user game
code executes. This is a pretty nice extra layer of developer nicities for us in that there is
one less thing to worry about (the `pdrealloc` is used in their helper `malloc()`, `free()`,
`realloc()`, implementations).

### `.bss`
Also remember that in the `setup.c` they make a point to put a pointer to the `__bss_start__`
and `__bss_end__` addresses in their own sections, so now we are up to 3 custom sections going
into the actual build step (in addition to the default `.text`, `.data` etc).

So how is this going to look when it actually builds?
