# pd-OS

As I've been going through this exercise of looking at the play.date console
I've been hoping there's some cool name for the underlying operating system.
Their Playdate account management and game distribution system is called
[WOPR](https://panic.com/blog/help-wanted-python-web-services-engineer-early-2022/),
and they made the legendary [Untitled Goose Game](https://goose.game/).
Unfortunately the OS is just called [Playdate OS](https://panic.com/blog/help-wanted-playdate-senior-qa-release-engineer-march-2022/).

Anyways, lets take a look at it.
